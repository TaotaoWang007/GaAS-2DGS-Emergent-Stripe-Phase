The file Emergent_Stripe_Phase1 is the original Origin file you shared with me. I made some edits and added more features to it.
GaAs_2DGS_Emergent_Stripe_Phase2. In this version, I saved some key variables from Phase 1 as .mat files to help speed things up. Phase 2 includes all the main calculations, like:

Finding the Fermi energy under an in-plane magnetic field

Plotting effective mass vs. energy

Trying to calculate Landau levels 

Electron's distribution check the results

Saving variables for plotting later in Igor Pro

So far, I've only added comments to the most important parts, but I'm working on adding more throughout the code.
